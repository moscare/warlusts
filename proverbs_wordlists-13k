The penny drops
The pot calling the kettle black
The powers that be
The proof of the pudding is in the eating
The quick and the dead
The real McCoy
The road less travelled
The salt of the earth
The sevenyear itch
The short end of the stick
The shot heard round the world
The skys the limit
The smallest room in the house
The tail wagging the dog
The third degree
The toast of the town
The triumph of hope over experience
The upper hand
The usual suspects
The whole Shebang
The whole kit and caboodle
The whole nine yards
The whole shebang
The writing is on the wall
The year dot

There but for  Grace of God

Thick and thin
Things that go bump in the night
Think outside the box
Thinking cap
Third time lucky
Thorn in the flesh
Thou shalt not kill
Though this be madness yet there is method in it
Three score and ten
Three sheets to the wind
Three strikes and you are out
Through thick and thin
Throw in the towel
Throw your hat into the ring
Thumbs up
Thus far into the bowels of the land
Ticked off
Tickle the ivories
Tickled pink
Tide over
Tie the knot
Till the cows come home
Tilting at windmills
Time and tide wait for no man
Tinkers dam
Tissue of lies
Tit for tat
Titfer
Tits up
To a T
To all intents and purposes
To be or not to be that is the question
To beggar belief
To big for your boots
To big for your breeches
To boldly go where no man has gone before
To boot
To cast the first stone
To gild refined gold to paint the lily
To sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub
To the manner born
To the nth degree
To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive
